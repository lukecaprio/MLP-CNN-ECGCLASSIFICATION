# MLP-CNN-ECGCLASSIFICATION
This project uses MLP and CNN deep neural networks in PyTorch to classify ECG signals with 85% accuracy. Techniques include ReLU activations, batch normalization, and average pooling. Includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation scripts for deep learning-based signal classification.
